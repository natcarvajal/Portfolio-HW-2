# Portfolio-HW-2

In this assignment, I was able to demonstrate a combination of all the skills I have learned so far, including HTML, CSS and Boostrap by creating my very own portfolio. I found it was very challenging to manuver through Bootstrap's grid system and also the multiple html pages, I have never done something like that before however I am very pleased with the end result of my portfolio. 

My porfolio consists of an About Me page with a breif introduction of myself, a Porfolio page including pictures of my family and I and finally a Contact Me page which has a direct link to my email. The footer on all these pages has clickable icons directing the user to my social media pages if they wish to view them. I am also pleased to have all my links working properly from the navbar to footer to the submit button on the contact page.
